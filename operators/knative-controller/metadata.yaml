  Knative service - controller

  Reconciles all the public Knative objects and autoscaling CRDs. When a user applies a Knative
  service to the Kubernetes API, this creates the configuration and route. It will convert the
  configuration into revisions and the revisions into deployments and Knative Pod Autoscalers
  (KPAs).
